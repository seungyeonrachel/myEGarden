# myEGarden
15-112 Term Project


My project is called "Your Mini Garden." Rather than a game, this app allows the user to plant and grow plants. The user also has control over the environmental settings, which also affect plants' growth. You can save your plant growth data and continue to play later.


This program uses python built in csv but does not use any outside modules or libraries. This means it can be simply run with 'control + b'. Run the "tp.py" file.


Because it takes time for plants to grow and die, I have made test lines that shorten the plant growth/death data (meaning they can grow and die easily):
